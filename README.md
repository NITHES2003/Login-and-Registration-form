# Login-and-Registration-form
## User Registration and Login System

This is a simple command-line-based user registration and login system. The project demonstrates basic user registration, login, and user interaction using C++.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can register by providing a username and password. The user data is stored in a plaintext file named "users.txt".
- User Login: Registered users can log in using their usernames and passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW for Windows)
- Basic understanding of terminal/command prompt usage

### Running the Project

1. Save the provided C++ code in a `.cpp` file, such as `app.cpp`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` file using the `cd` command.
4. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
   - For example: **g++ task_manager.cpp -o task_manager**
5. Run the executable file by the command: **app**
